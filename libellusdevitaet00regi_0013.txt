PREFACE.

ξ 1. THE present volume contains an account of the Life and
Mil-acles of Godric, the Hermit Saint of F inchale, written by his
contemporary, Regina]d‚ a monk of Durham. Before speaking of
the work now before us, it may be expedient that we should
make a few remarks upon such other of Godrio's biographers as
are known to us.

§2 The first of these who claims our notice is Germanus,
prior of Durham. His narrative is unfortunately no longer ex-
tant in a perfect form; and we have reason to regret its loss,
Since, from the opportunities of acquiring information which he
enjoyed„ it could not but be important. At the time of St. God-
ric“s death he was prior of Durham3 and for seven years before
that event the Saint had placed himself under the jurisdiction of
Germanus in his official capacity as prior of that monastery.
Godrie was in consequence regarded as a member of that brother-
hood, and was considered to be a monk of Durham. From the
relative position of the two parties we might have fairly conjec-
tured that there was frequent and intimate communion between
them. But we are not left to speculate upon this head3 for we
have the authority of Germanus himself for stating¹ that he was
admitted to Godric's inmost thoughts, that he was acquainted
with many particulars respecting him which were unknown to all
others, and that he reposed, as he emphatically expresses himself,
in the very bosom of his confidelice.²

¹ Testatur haec idem Germanus ita scribens: “ O quanta in auribus meis ex
illius ore stillaverunt mirabilia ! quanta dc conclavi secretorum suorum crebris
collocutionibus mihi exposuit laude dignissima Ε Multa mihi quac alios latent.
Dormicbam in sinu familiaritatis ejus.”-—Prologus in vitam S. Godrici‚ auctore
Galsrido, ξ 1

² Geoffrey explains this by informing us that Godric was 111 the habit of con-
fessing to Ge1n1anus:‘⁴ Ei onim [scil Germano] quam maxime credendum
censui quem vir sanctus etex opimone bonae vitae specialem habuemt, et ex

gradus auctoiitatc et crebrae confessionis familiaritate spiritualem sibi in 'Christo
fecelat patrem? ⁷—Ibid.
