46 LIBELLUS DE VITA

*senior et grandaevus; iste vero, mediocris aetatis, statu matu-
rus3 quorum alter in curia Beati Guthberti ab adolescentiae
primordiis· 1inter monachos educatus fuit, et ideo magis altero
discretae conversationis religionem agnovit; qui sacrae fidei
amore succensus, ad solitudinis illius 2110101111101011111, data sibi
a domnis suis permissione, est conversus.

§3L At tamen locus ipse tunc temporis multis erat incog-
nitus, utpote in abditissimis silvarum sinibus abditissimus3 nulla,
aut certe vel rarissima, in illis nemoreis finibus esse casa potuit
prae nimia et rabida frendentium ³luporum insania, et quae pro
inexplebili ingluvie etiam tunc hominibus vix pepercit; mul-
titudo quidem eorum erat tunc nimia, et ideo praedae captura
saevientibus putabatur esse perminima. Ad id locorum vero,
quo viri isti tunc degebant, solitum refugii domicilium luporum
vulgus habere solebant; nempe hominibus pene impenetrabile

¹ Inter monachos educatus] Mai-tene, de Antiq. Ecclesiae ritibus (iii. 93), tells
us that it was bv no means uncommon for monks to become dissatisfied with the
Benedictine ruli-33 and, in search of perfectiori, to become recluses. The history
of the church of Durham furnishes examples in addition to that mentioned in
the text, as, for instance, Cuthbert and his successors at Farne (Beda, H. E.
5, 13 Vita S. Cuthberti, cap. xvii.); and afterwards Bartholomew (Aeta SS.
J un. iv. 834). A succession of hermits occupied a cell near Nor-ham.

2 Heremitoreum] So corrected from ‘⁴ herernitum,” the reading of B.,· Hor-
reum Η.

³ L’uporzcm] Besides the well-known story of the war waged by king Edgar
against the wolves, there are many proofs of their frequency in England. The
head of St. Edmund, king and martyr, was miraculously preserved by a wolf.
(Brompt'on, ap. Decem Script. 001. 806.) Conari, ear] of Britanny and Rich-
mond, when he hunted in the forest of Wensleydale, about the period when the
incident mentioned by Reginald must have occurred, was greatly displeased on
observing the great increase of wolves within the district, (Monast. Anglic. v.
572, edit. Ellis,) and he gave to the monks of Jorvall the injunction, “Quod
habeant mastivos ad lupos coercendos de pasturls suis.'’ Ibid. Henry III.
gave them the singular privilege, ‘⁶ Quod habeant feras luporum morsu peremp-
tas, quas ipsi vel servientes sui in foresta illa invene1·int.'’ (Id. p. 576.) A fine,
printed in WVhittaker's Richmond, (ii. 354) grants from William de Moubray
to Adam de Staveley the privilege to destroy the wolf. It is without date, but
supposed to be 111 1110 reign of king John. In 1281 Edward Ι. granted to Peter
Corbet permission to kill wolves in the counties of Gloucester, Worcester,
Hereford, Shropshire, and Stafford. (Foed. ii. 168, 0(111. 1705.) There was
much need sor their extirpation 111 these quarters, for it appears that the park of
Farley in Worcestershire was nearly devastated by them. Abbrev. Rot. Plac.
18 Edw. I. Rot. 50, p. 283. Juliana Berners reekons the wolf among the
beasts of Venery. (Sec Ames's Herbert, p. 1434.) XVhen Harrison wrote his
description of Britain, in 1586,1110 wolf had long been extimet in England. He
adds, however, ‘⁶ This is chiefly spoken of the south and south-west parts of the
island. For whereas we that dwell on this side of the Tweed may safely boast
of our security on this behalf, yet cannot 1110 Seots do the like in every point
within their kingdom, sith they have grievous wolvcs and cruel sexes.'⁷ 'Hollin-
shed's Chronicles, i. 378, edit. 1807.
