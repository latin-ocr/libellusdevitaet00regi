atque miser aliquantulum ita relevatus, Domino in Sancti God-

CLXXV. DE OAECA.

ᾧ 549. MULJER quaedam, Adeliza nomine, de Puntelande, per
multos annos unius oculi lumine privata penitus exstitit; quae ut
ad viri Dei sepulchrum pervenit, nocte ipsa lumen perfecte rece-
pit, et socios qui cum illa advenerant, devotiores et hilariores red-
didit.

crxxvr. DE PUERo INFLATO.

ἓ 550. HAEc eadem mulier puerum parvulum habuit, cui corpus
totum ab imo usque ad summum, quantum pellis distendi potuit,
tumore clarissimo et rubenti ac durissimo inflatum misere fuit.
Quem illo in ulnis delatum secum, eadem nocte advesperescente,
ad pedes sepulchri constituit; sed die crastino, cunctis videntibus
et Deo gratias referentibus, nullum omnino in ipso signum pris-
tini tumoris vel doloris apparuit. Quem etiam iterum, altero
anno vertente, mater Sancto Dei gratias referens retulit, ac sanis-
simum coram cunctis ostendit3 et ob hujus facti miraculum,
puerum ipsum de Willelmo fecit, praecipiente Domino per visum,
exinde lnominari Groclricum.

¹ Nominari Godriczcm] The idea of the Christian name was not in the pri-
mitive church so intimately associated with the act of baptism as it is with us.
So far from being given at that time, it was bestowed some days before baptism.
See Menard's Note to the Sacramentary of St. Gregory the Great, Note 321.
The name might also be changed upon fitting occasions. Thus it became custo·
mary with the popes to assume a new name from the period of Sergius the First.
Thus also Odo, bishop of Paris, in his Synodical constitutions (which may be
referred to a date shortly after thc incident mentioned in this chapter) decr-ees
thus : “Saepe dicatur laicis quod possint mutare nomina pueris, si velint, in
confirmatione, aut si visum fucrit expedire.’' Labb. x. 1802. If the bishop at
confirmation called the recipient by a different name from that given at baptism,
the name given at confirmation became thenceforth the proper Christian name.
Thus Chief J ustice Gawdy’s baptismal name was Thomas, but having been con-
firmed by that of Francis, he bore the latter, and, by the advice of all the judges,
used it in his purchases and grants. But on the revisa] of the Liturgy at. the
Restoration, a change took place in the form of the office of Confirmation, and
the Bishop had no longer occasion to mention the christian name. See on the law
of the question, Hubback on the Evidence of Succession, p.451; 8v0.Lond. 1844.
