xii PREFAcE.

Ailred's request Reginald visited Godrio at Finchale, for the pur-
pose of collecting, from the Saint's own mouth, materials upon
which the intended biography was to be founded. Reginald has
preserved an account of the interview which took place 011 that
occasion. He tells us that he introduced the subject with cau-
tion, but at length he candidly avowed the object of his mission.
Godric was displeased, and gave him no encouragement 3 he
described himself as an unpropitious subject for biography, fitted
rather to be a warning of what ought to be avoided than an ex-
ample of what might be imitated. Reginald retired in confusion,
and it was not until after several years had elapsed that Godric,
of his own accord, communicated to him the details upon which
this life is founded, and after its completion its author took it to
the Saint, then confined to his death-bech and Godric, when he
had been made aware that he himself was the individual whom
it depicted, charged Reginald that the narrative should not be

that the author would be subjected to rebuke and contumely for
the statements which it contained, a prophecy which, Reginald
tells us, was amply fulfilled in his own bitter experience.1

which he knew he should incur by appearing as Godric's bio-
grapher, (although one cannot exactly understand why,) thought
it expedient to conceal his name in the first instanceg but the
difficulties, whatever they may have been, by which he was sur-
rounded, having been removed through the infiuence of Bishop
Pudsey, he no longer scrupled to announce himself as its author.

ᾗ 10. It has already been stated that Reginald possessed ample
opportunities of acquiring accurate and authentic information re-
specting the individua] whose biography he had undertaken to ³
narrate. We have his own authority for stating that he derived
this information from three sources; his own observation, the
particulars furnished by Godric himself, and the authority of
others who had enjoyed the means of knowing the truth of the
statements which they supplied the biographer, and in whose
