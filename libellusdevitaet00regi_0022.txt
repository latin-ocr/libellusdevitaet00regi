xvi PREFAOE.

ham named Swalwell, who died shortly before the suppression of
the monastery. It seems to have lingered in the same locality
until it came into the possession of Anthony Maxton, prebendary
of that cathedral,1 who presented it to Augustine Lindsell,2 also
a prebendary, afterwards successively Bishop of Hereford and
Peterborough.3 Lindsell gave it to Archbishop Laud, with the
remainder of whose collection of manuscripts it passed into the
Bodleian Library, where it is yet preserved.

ᾗ 15. Two documents are appended to this Preface, since they
both are too intimately connected with St. Godric to be omitted
in a publication like the present. The former of these4 is an ex-
tract from the Chronicle of William, a monk of the Benedictine
monastery of Newborough in Yorkshire, which is valuable as
containing a notice of our Saint written by an eye-witness. It
accurately coincides with the information contained in' the other
authorities here printed. The second⁵ is a poem upon the life of
St. Gothic, transcribed from the only known copy, which is con-
tained in the Harleian manuscript of Reginakl's work here
printed. The editor regrets that it contains‘passages which to
him are unintelligible, but, such as it is, he presents it to the
readen

 

The editor begs leave to offer his thanks to the Rev. Dr. Ban-
dinel, Keeper of the Bodleian Library. for permission to tran-
scribe the manuscript of this work, and for the facilities which
he kindly afforded during the progress of that task. The thanks
of the editor are also due to the Rev. H. O. Ooxe, one of the
Librarians of the same establishment‚ for his kindness in ex-
amining the proof·sheets with the original manuscript whenever
the occurrence of an incorrect or doubtful passage rendered such
collation expedient.
