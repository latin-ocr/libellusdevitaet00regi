PREFAOE. ix

did without much skill, by weaving into one continued history a
succession of extracts from the life written by Germanus, to which
we have already alluded, and from that of Reginald, here printed
in its entire form. It is obvious, therefore, that this production
of Geoffrey's is of itself of little value, further than inasmuch as it
preserves materials which might otherwise have perished. The
Prologue, the only portion which has been deemed worthy of in-
sertion in this place, is given 111 1110 Appendix to this Preface.l

From this work, as most generally known and most easily ac-
cessible, the generality of writers have borrowed their information
respecting St. Godric. It is printed by the Bollandists in the
“Acta Sanctoruns'ss from a manuscript at Citeaux, communicated
to the editors by J acobus Lannoius, a monk of that order.
Other copies in manuscript are by no means uncommon33 but
there is one to which we think it expedient more particularly to
refer, from the circumstance of its having been transcribed in the
north of England, possibly by a monk of Durham. We allude
to a manuscript now in the possession of the Dean and Chapter
of Winchester, of which a detailed account and a collation is
given in the Appendix to this Preface, No. ΙΙΙ.

ᾧ 5. We now come to speak of the Life of St. Godric written
by Reginald, the most valuable in every respect with which we
are acquainted, not only from its minuteness of detail, but also
from the peculiar opportunities which its writer possessed of
knowing the truth of the incidents which he has narrated. But,
before assuming its present completed form, in which it is here
given to the reader, it had passed through two intermediate stages.

To the former of these, represented by the Harleian Manu-
script 3122,4 (which, for the sake of distinction, has been usually
designated as the anonymous Harleian Legend,) the author does
not affix his name; there is no dedication, as in the completed
edition, to Bishop Pudsey3 the whole narrative is much abridged
and stripped of many of those little details which invest it, in its
