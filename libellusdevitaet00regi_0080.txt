¹ Ierosolirmmz] See ξ» 284. At a very early period of the history of the
Christian Chureh, pilgrimages to Jerusalem were introduced. St. J erome, in his
Epistle to Paulinus, (Ep. xii. p. 39, fol. Ant. 1578,) writes, “ De toto huc orbe
concurritur, plena est civitas universi generis hominum.’' His friends Paula
and Eustochium addressed a letter from Palestine to Marcella, urging her to
join them, which contains the following passages, among many others, showing
the frequeney of the usage : “ Quicunque in Gallia fuerit primus, huc properat.
Divisus ab orbe nostro Britannus, si in religione processerit, occiduo sole
dimisso, quaerit locum fama sibi tantum et seripturarum relatione cognitum.”
(Ep. xvii. p. 52.) At a later period St. David is said to have gone thither.
(Aeta SS. Mar. i. 44.) Beda in his Hist. Eeclesiastica (v. 15, 16) embodies
extraets from a description of the Holy Land written by Arcwolf, who had
visited Jerusalem, Damascus, Constantinople, and Alexandria, before the year
700. St. Thomas, about A.D. 700, went to visit the Sepulchre of the Lord.
(Acta SS. Sept. ii. 605.) After the capture of Jerusalem by Geoffrey de Bouillon
in the year 1099, (Art de verifier les Dates, i. 436,) and the establishment of
the order of the Hospitallers, the difficulties of the Journey were diminished, and
a greater number of pilgrims undertook the expedition. Contemporary, or
nearly so, with St. Godric were Cholomann, a Scottish or Irish pilgrim3 and
his companions. (Acta SS. Oet. vi. 358.) Gerard died on his way thither. (Id.
Aug. ii. 695.) Bernard also visited that city. (ld. Oet. vi. 630.) Guido went
twice thither, (Id Sept. iv. 430 and as many visits were made by Oldegarius,
bishop of Barcelona. (Id. Mart. i. 488.) Another example is furnished by
Gerald. (Id. April. i. 418.) St. Anselm wrote a letter to his brother-in-law,
Burgundius, advising him as to the best mode of settling his affairs before
undertaking a journey thither. (Ep. iii. 66, p. 391, edit. 1721.) The frequency
of the eustom is thus notieed by Glaber Rodulphus, iii. 1 .· “ T unc temporis
coeperunt pene universi, qui de Italia et Gallia ad Sepulchrum Domini Hiero-
solymis ire cupiebant, consuetum iter, quod erat per fretum maris, omittere,
atque per hujus regionis [Hungariae] patriam transitum habere. Ille vero [S.
Stephanus] tutissimam omnibus constituit viam. Excipiebat ut fratres quos-
cumque videbat, dabatque illis immensa munera. Cujus rei gratia provocata
innumerabilis multitudo tam nobilium quam vulgi 'populi Hierosolimam abi-
e1·unt.'' The frequency of the expedition necessarily diminished upon the ex-
pulsion of the Christians from the Holy Land3 but instances occur at alater
date. Thus St. Ursuline of Parma, in the early part of the fifteenth century,
spent some time in visiting the more important loealities in Palestine. (Acta SS.
April. i. 733.) Subsequent expeditions are mentioned in the notes appended to
‘⁶ A Survey of Egypt and Syria, undertaken, A.D. 1422, by Sir Gilbert de Lan-
noy, Knt. Translated from a manuscript in the Bodleian Library, Oxford‚ with
an introductory translation and notes of illustration and reference to the
Croisades 3⁵⁷ printed in the Archaeologia, xxi. 281. See also Augusti, Hand-
buch der Christlich. Archaol. iii. 377, edit. 1837.

² Beati Jacohi Apostoli limina] See ἓξ 171, 254, 281. St. James of Com-
postclla, in Spain. About this very time pope Calixtus the Second, out of his
reverenee to St. James, raised to metropolitan dignity the see of Compostella.
It is not improbable that this incident might have induced St. Godric to journey
thither. See Baronii A11na1.A.D. 1123, ξ 1. Other instances of pilgrimages
undertaken by Englishmen during the reign of Henry II. may be seen in the
Decem script. 1110,1126. See also Acta SS. Jul. toni. vi. p. 116, and Du
Cange's Gloss, v. Jacobitae.
