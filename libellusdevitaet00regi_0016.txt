matured stage, with so much interest 3 and its arrangement dif-
fers very considerably from that which the author ultimately
adopted.l The whole, however, was thought worthy of preser-
vation, as forming, as it most probably did, the groundwork of the
more elaborated performance here given to the world, and it ac-
cordingly is appended in a series of foot-notes, each placed under
the corresponding portions of the work here adopted as the text.
There ean be no reasonable doubt that, although anonymous, it
was written by Reginald. The style, indeed, varies considerably
from that elsewhere employed by our writer, which is much more
diffuse, ambitious, and descriptive than the bare and unpretend-
ing narrative of ‘the nanieless author3 so much so, that, had we
no other test whereby to discover its authorship, we should at
once decide that it was ποί written by Reginald. But this diffi-
culty, how great soever it may seem to be at first sight, vanishes
when we compare together the information which they each con-
tain, and test the anonyinous legend with that to which Reginald
has affixed his name. Their identity of authorship is then evi-
dent, not only from the manner in which they each detail the
same events, but from the information which they inutually give
respecting the circumstances under which each was written.
This will be exhibited so fully and so frequently in the progress
of the narrative that, at present, it is unnecessary to enlarge upon
it further.2

ξ 6. The next step brings the work before us in a much more
matured form. The bare and scanty outline of the last-mentioned
narrative is here clothed with descriptive incident until it be-
comes expanded into a detailed and elaborate history; yet, if it
differs in this respect from that which we have already described,
it has some important features which distinguish it from the nar-
rative by which it was afterwards succeeded. Unlike the com-
pleted biography, it is anonymous ς in many respects it varies in
its arrangement of the order of events from that which was ulti-
mately adopted ;3 it has some few particulars which find no place
