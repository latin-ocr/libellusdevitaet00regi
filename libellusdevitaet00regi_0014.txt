viii PREFACE.

ἓ 3. We have already stated that this work is no longer extant
in a perfect state ς and for what remains we are indebted to an-
other biographer of St. Godric, whom we shall presently mention,
Geoffrey, a monk of Durham. He tells us, that, after he had made
considerable progress in writing a life of St. Godric, a monk of
Durham supplied him With the narrative drawn up by the late
prior; and that, in consequence of the information thus supplied,
he made several corrections and additions to his own composition.
This he has done, fortunately for us, in a very unartistic manner,
giving such passages as appeared to him to be of importance in
the ipsissima verba of his predecessor, whose name he prefixes to
each of those extracts which he thought worthy of preservation.
Geoffrey remarks that the information supplied by Germanus
differs in many respects from that of Reginald; but he appears
to have somewhat overstated the discrepancies which exist be-
tween them. So close, indeed, is the harmony which prevails
between the two narratives, that, with a single exception given
below, it was considered unnecessary to reprint the portions
which could be recovered of this work of Grermanus.l This prior
of Durham died in the year 1189; his life of St. Godric must
consequently have been written, at the latest, within nineteen
years of the Saint's decease. ,

§ 4. Our next authority is Geoffrey, the individual of whom
we have already spoken. His aera, and the sources of informa-
tion which he possessed, are easily ascertained from the informa-
tion which he has embodied in the prologue prefixed to his work.
The date of its composition, or at least of its completion, is ascer-
tained by the fact that it is dedicated to Thomas prior of Fin-
chale, who died in the year 1196, twenty-four years after the
death of Godric. He tells us, that, when a boy, he had spoken to
the Saint, then an aged man, and that this interview had left an
agreeable impression upon his memory. Beyond a description of
that individuaPs personal appearance, which has all the minute-
ness of a boyish recollection, the sources of information which
were open to Geoffrey were of two kinds, either communications
from those who had themselves known Godric, or existin g written
materials. He seems to have neglected the former of these, and
to have confined himself to the latter. He had before him two
documents, out of which he compiled his own narrative. This he
