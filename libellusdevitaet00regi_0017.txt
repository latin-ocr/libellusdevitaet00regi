PREFAOE. xi

in the third recension; and in many instances it is less perfect
and complete than that version of St. Godrids history. Still it
is not without its value, since it probably exhibits Reginald's im-
pression of events when they were fresher and more recent in his
memory, and as such it has been collated with the text which
has here been adopted, and its variations preserved at the bottom
of the page. It is to be regretted that the only manuscript of
this work which has come down to us is of very modern date,
having been written about the beginning of the sixteenth century,
and by a scribe whose accuracy cannot be commended.¹

ξ 7. We now speak of Reginald's third and final recension of
his work, that which is for the first time printed entire in the
present volume. It is distinguished from its predecessors by
one very important peculiarity, its author's name is prefixed in
a letter dedicating the completed narrative to Bishop Pudsey.
It differs from that which we last described, by the adoption of a
different arrangement3 by the rejection of a few incidents, for the
retention of which it may be assumed Reginald had in the mean
time discovered that he had no sufficient authority3 by the further
and more elaborate expansion of the narrative in some minor par-
ticulars, relating chiefly, however, to style and description rather
than to incident. In this third and matured condition Reginald's
narrative now comes before us, and we proceed to speak of it
accordingly.

§8. He himself has furnished us with some few details re-
specting the circumstances 'under which it was undertaken and
written. It was suggested to him by Ailred, the well—known
Abbot of Rievaulx, himself an author of celebrity, and in such
an urgent manner as left him no alternative but to devote him-
self to its execution. Ailred was of Durham extraction, as we
learn from another of Reginald's biographical productions,‘2 and
had enjoyed persona] acquaintance with the Saint himself.3 At

pared with the corresponding chapters in the Bodleian manuscript, is printed in
the Appendix to this Preface, No. VI.

¹ The only copy known to the editor is that contained in the Harleian MS„
153, a volume which is not older than the commeneement of the sixteenth cen-
tury. This, or another copy of the same volume, was known to Harpsfield, who
has cited it frequently in his “Historia Anglicanae Ecclesiae,'' (sec. xii. cap.
xlv. p. 407, fol. Duae. 1622.)
