xiv PREFACE.

to him while he was employed as a merchant and as a sailor, his
various pilgrimages to Rome, Compostella, and Jerusalem, and,
in fact, all that occurred before the period to which Reginald's
own persona] observation extends. We are also indebted to the
same authority for what is recorded as to the various communi-
cations with the unseen world with which Godric was from time
to time favoured, and which necessarily, from their very nature,
rest upon his own unsupported statement.1 There is one obser-
vation too intimately connected with this part of the subject to be
passed over in silence. During the whole period of Reginald's
intercourse with Godric, which appears to have been of the most
familiar and intimate character, and of no brief duration, nothing
occurred to shake his belief in the veracity, or, indeed, in the
general credibility of his informant's statements. How far they
are in themselves worthy of credit, or how far we at present
might be content to accept them, is a distinct question, and one
which does not fall within our province, nor the drift of the pre-
sent inquiry to discuss3 but it is worthy of notice that Reginald
has no misgivings as to the truth of the incidents which he has
undertaken to narrate, nor does he seem to anticipate any diffi-
culty on this head as likely to occur in the minds of others.2

ἓ 13. Reginald derived much of his information from the testi—
mony of others. When he was obliged to rely upon this kind of
evidence he was careful, he tells us, to accept nothing for which
he could not adduce the most respectable authority ;3 and it must
be admitted that he seems to have acted upon the rule which he
had laid down for his guidance. He generally gives us to under-
stand how it was that the informant, on whose testimony he re-
lied, had the means of knowing the truth of the narrative. Not
only does he mention in general 16111154 that his informa-tion is
derived from those who had it from the lips of God1·ichimself,⁵

¹ Thus 116 relates to Reginald his interview with the Blessed Virgin Mary
and Mai-y Magdalene, ξ 112 ; 1115 interview with St. John the Baptist, ξ 118 ;
the vision of the Boy who issued from the Crucifix, ξ 149 ; how he saw souls
ascending into heaven, ξ 164, 165 ; 1115 contest with the devil, ξ 190 ; and the
vision which 116 had of our Blessed Lord, ξ 210. Other instances might be added.

neque quicquam pro alicujus relatione quem nec prius fuisse veracissimum rela-
torem comperi,'’ ξ 6.
