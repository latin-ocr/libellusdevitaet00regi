§ 11. It was the custom of the prior of Durham, for the time
being, to take care that upon each festival of the church one of
his monks should be despatched to Finchale, there to celebrate
divine service.2 Reginald was sometimes sent upon this missi0n;³
and, upon the approach of the long-protracted illness which con-
fined him for nearly eight years to his bed,4 the care of the inva-
lid was sometimes entrusted to Reginald.5 He took advantage
of the opportunities thus afforded him of conversing with St. God-
ric, and of learning from him many of those particulars which
render this narrative so interesting and valuable.6 There is no
reason to imagine that he did this carelessly or faithlessly3 indeed,
there is every reason to believe the contrary. It had been his con-
stant custom, but unknown to Godric, to reduce to writing such
incidents as that individual mentioned to him in conversation,
while the impression was yet fresh in his memory3 and he in-
forms* us, that, in so doing, it was his wish to preserve the very
words and expressions which had been employed.⁷

ᾧ 12. Our remarks upon the second source whence Reginald
derived his information respecting Godric, namely, from his own

by what we have already stated in the last paragraph. To

connected with his earlier history, the events which occurred

§297. So accurate does he appear to have been on this head, that he has

thought it necessary to inform us upon one occasion that he was unable to re-
cord the particulars ot a conversation, ξ 190.
